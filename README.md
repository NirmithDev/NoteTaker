# NoteTaker

## Tech Used:
BackEnd  : Python (Django Framework) <br>
FrontEnd : JavaScript (React - Vite) <br>
DataBase : SQLite3

## Purpose:
As a student in university I found it incredibly difficult to create my notes while having my laptop on my table so I decided it would be best if I could create a applciation that can host my own notes and can be shared with anyone curious to see it.

I am also building this for a friend to help him since he is struggling with carple tunnel syndrome and I really want to get AI formatting and Latex formatting incorporated and hosted on Docker so baby steps!
